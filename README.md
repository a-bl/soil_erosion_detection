# soil_erosion_detection
### Loading data
For loading data two packages were used: 
- rasterio 
Rasterio reads and writes GeoTIFF and other formats to organize and store gridded raster datasets such as satellite imagery and terrain models and provides a Python API based on Numpy N-dimensional arrays
- geopandas
The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS
